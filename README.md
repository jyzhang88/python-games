# Repository for games written using Python

A personal repository where I upload Python codes for some games. It's just for personal challenge, and more importantly to improve on my Python coding skills. Hopefully one day I'll look back and edit the codes to make them more efficient. 


### tictactoe.py

Import `tictactoe.py` and run `lets_play()` function to initiate the game.
The flowthrough of the game:

1. Determine who starts first, **X** or **O**
2. Print the board
3. Player enters a digit to mark the choice
4. Check if digit already taken
5. If not, replace digit with X or O
6. Print the board
7. Check if someone has won the game
8. If not, repeat steps 3-7 until someone wins the game
9. The loop ends when someone wins the game
10. It is a tie if no one wins the game
